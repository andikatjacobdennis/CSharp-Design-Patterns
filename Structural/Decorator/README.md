# **Decorator Pattern** in **C#**

## Overview

This project demonstrates the **Decorator Pattern** using a practical example of **adding dynamic features (border, scroll) to a UI component like a text view**.

The **Decorator Pattern** is a **structural** pattern that **attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing**.

In this example, we have:

* **`Client`**: The part of the system that uses the decorated component (here, the main program).
* **`VisualComponent`**: The abstract base class that all UI components implement.
* **`TextView`**: A concrete UI component that displays text.
* **`Decorator`**: The abstract decorator that wraps a `VisualComponent` and forwards requests.
* **`BorderDecorator`, `ScrollDecorator`**: Concrete decorators that add borders or scrollbars to the component.

## Structure

### Diagram

![UML Diagram illustrating the pattern](diagram_placeholder.png)

### 1. Core Interface / Abstract Class

* **`VisualComponent`**: Defines the common operations that all components and decorators must provide, such as `Draw()`.

### 2. Concrete Implementations

* **`TextView`**: Provides basic behavior for displaying text.
* **`BorderDecorator`**: Adds a border around the component when drawn.
* **`ScrollDecorator`**: Adds scrolling capability around the component when drawn.

### 3. Client

* **`Program`**: Interacts with components through `VisualComponent`. It remains unaware of the concrete decorators used.

### 4. Optional Orchestrator

* Not strictly required here; the decorators themselves manage composition.

## Example Usage

```csharp
using System;

namespace DecoratorPatternDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // 1. Create the base component
            VisualComponent textView = new TextView();

            Console.WriteLine("Simple TextView:");
            textView.Draw();

            // 2. Decorate with a border
            VisualComponent borderedTextView = new BorderDecorator(textView, 2);
            Console.WriteLine("\nTextView with Border:");
            borderedTextView.Draw();

            // 3. Decorate with scroll + border
            VisualComponent decoratedTextView =
                new BorderDecorator(
                    new ScrollDecorator(textView), 3
                );
            Console.WriteLine("\nTextView with Scrollbar and Border:");
            decoratedTextView.Draw();
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Simple TextView:
Drawing TextView

TextView with Border:
Drawing TextView
Drawing border with width 2

TextView with Scrollbar and Border:
Drawing TextView
Drawing scrollbar
Drawing border with width 3
```

## Benefits

* **Loose Coupling**: The client depends on `VisualComponent` and not on specific decorators.
* **Flexibility and Extensibility**: New decorators can be added without modifying existing code.
* **Single Responsibility**: Each decorator focuses on a single added feature (border, scroll).
* **Simplified Client Code**: The client simply composes decorators and calls `Draw()`.

---

## Common Use Cases

* Dynamically adding responsibilities to objects without creating a subclass for each combination.
* Adding features to GUI components (scrollbars, borders, shadows, etc.).
* Enhancing streams or I/O objects (compression, encryption, buffering).
* Logging or debugging wrappers around existing objects.

---

## Implementation Notes

* **Interface vs. Abstract Class**: Use an abstract class (`VisualComponent`) when sharing code among decorators; otherwise, an interface suffices.
* **Dynamic Composition**: Decorators can be combined in any order, allowing flexible behavior.
* **Overhead**: Many small objects are created, so balance flexibility with performance needs.

If you want, I can also **draw the UML diagram for this C# Decorator example** and embed it in Markdown so it’s ready to include in your documentation.

Do you want me to do that next?
