## 1. Difference between Factory Method and Builder

Factory Method is about **what type** of object to create, while Builder is about **how to construct** a complex object. 

Factory Method lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate, while Builder helps create objects step-by-step when they have many parts or configurations.
